# ElevenLabs Timestamp Implementation Stubs and Issues

This directory contains tasks to fix the stubbing and production quality issues found in the ElevenLabs timestamp handling implementation.

## Summary of Issues Found

The ElevenLabs timestamp implementation was partially completed but contains **critical stubbing** that makes the saved timestamp data mostly useless:

### Critical Stubbing Issues
1. **Synthesis metadata completely stubbed** - All context fields set to "unknown"
2. **Audio chunk timing calculations stubbed** - start_ms/end_ms hardcoded to 0
3. **Missing context propagation** - No way to access TTS parameters during timestamp generation

### Production Quality Issues  
4. **Unwrap() usage violations** - Against CLAUDE.md production standards
5. **Error type inconsistencies** - Mixed error type paths causing potential compilation issues
6. **Missing validation** - No validation of ElevenLabs alignment data integrity
7. **No domain type integration** - Doesn't use existing fluent_voice_domain timestamp types
8. **Insufficient testing** - Only basic time formatting tests, missing integration and edge case tests

## Task Execution Order

**Phase 1: Core Architecture (Required First)**
- Task 8: Add Context Propagation Architecture
- Task 3: Fix Unwrap Usage Violations  
- Task 4: Fix Error Type Inconsistencies

**Phase 2: Stub Replacement**
- Task 1: Fix Synthesis Metadata Stubbing
- Task 2: Implement Audio Chunk Timing Calculations

**Phase 3: Production Quality**
- Task 5: Add Alignment Data Validation
- Task 6: Integrate with Domain Timestamp Types
- Task 7: Add Comprehensive Testing

## What Actually Works

✅ **Time formatting functions** - SRT/VTT conversion is correctly implemented  
✅ **Basic data structures** - Timestamp metadata structs are well-designed  
✅ **Word aggregation algorithm** - Character-to-word grouping logic is complete  
✅ **Module organization** - Files are properly structured and exported  

## Impact Assessment

**Critical**: Tasks 1, 2, 8 - Without these, timestamp data is mostly useless
**High**: Tasks 5, 6, 7 - Required for production deployment  
**Medium**: Tasks 3, 4 - Code quality and robustness improvements

These tasks will transform the current partial implementation with stubs into production-ready timestamp handling that actually preserves and processes ElevenLabs timing data correctly.
